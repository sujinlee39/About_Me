    <h1>About Sujin Lee</h1>
    <img src="images/sujin_six.jpg" alt="Sujin Six years old">
    <p>My name is Sujin Lee and I'm taking the first year at Fanshawe College program.<br>
    To briefly tell about myself, I'm 19 years old and I was born in South Korea.<br>
    I moved to Canada when I was 12 years old with my family.<br>
    At first, it was really hard to learn the new language. However, I tried my best to speak English better.<br>
    Moving to Canada was a really big change in my life.<br>
    I want to visit Korea to see my friends and family but I don't want to live there anymore.<br>
    I'm really enjoying living in Canada with my family and hope to get a good career after college.</p>
