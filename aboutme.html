      <p>My name is Sujin Lee and I'm taking the first year at Fanshawe College program.
      To briefly tell about myself, I'm 19 years old and I was born in South Korea.
      I moved to Canada when I was 12 years old with my family.
      At first, it was really hard to learn the new language. However, I tried my best to speak English better.
      Moving to Canada was a really big change in my life.
      I want to visit Korea to see my friends and family but I don't want to live there anymore.
      I'm really enjoying living in Canada with my family and hope to get a good career after college.</p>

      <p>I love cooking Korean foods and from the left, it is called stir-fried Kimchi rice with ketchup.
        Next, it is called chicken soup rice.
        The last food is called soybean soup with mushroom, zucchini, onion, potato, tofu and
        any other vegetable like green onion, hot pepper, and chopped garlic.
        There are more delicious Korean foods that I can make!
        Since my parents left to the different province,
        I'm living with my little brother who still goes to high school and
        I need to pack his lunch every morning so I try to make the food really tasty!</p>

      <p>Lastly, those are my neighborhood photos that I took when I was going back home.
        I like taking pictures of the landscape, especially with colourful sky colours!</p>
